// What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

// addLength('apple ban') => ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
// addLength('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
// Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element .

// Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.

const addLength = str => str.split(" ").map(el => `${el} ${el.length}`);
