// Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

// Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

// Here's, an example:

// f(n=100) // returns 5050
// It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).

// Note: the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do performance optimization on your code.

// Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

// Credits: this kata was inspired by the farzher's kata 'Sum of large ints' . In fact, it can be seen as a sort of prep kata for that one.

const f = n => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return n > 0 && n === Math.floor(n) ? sum : false;
};
