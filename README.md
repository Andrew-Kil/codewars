## Kata

![Kata Example](assets/codewars-kata.png)

This is an example of a codewars kata where you are asked to write an algorithm that moves all of the zeros to the end while preserving the order of the other elements. The solution must pass all test cases in order to be accepted as a valid solution.

The katas are assigned a difficulty level (8 kyu is the easiest, 7 kyu is more difficult, etc).

Once the solution is accepted, the user is taken to a list of the highest rated solutions submitted by other users where you can learn different approaches to solving that kata and vote for your favorite solutions.

This repository stores solutions to katas that I have solved in primarily JavaScript. I'm currently in the process of cleaning up the files so that they are consistent and display:
